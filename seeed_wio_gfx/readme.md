Wio Terminal

## Description

Screen driver library designed for Wio Terminal's built-in 2.4-inch 320×240 TFT LCD, with graphics, text, animation, and SD-card video support.

## Quick Start

1. Enable `@aily-project/lib-seeed-wio-gfx` for a Wio Terminal project.
2. Initialize the built-in screen in `arduino_setup()` and select its SPI frequency. The default is 50 MHz; `MAX (CPU/2)` is available for testing and may cause display corruption.
3. Add drawing, text, animation, or SD-video blocks; RGB565 SD video uses double-buffer DMA when memory allows.
